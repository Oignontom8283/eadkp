- C/C++ support test.
- Optimization of binary generation:
    - Unused C/C++ code is no longer compiled or linked, reducing the size of the final binaries.
- C/C++ support in the simulator:
    - C/C++ code is now compiled and linked when running in the simulator, not just on the real device.
- Support for `c/` and `cpp/` folders for C/C++ code.
- Change of EIF file extension:
    - EIF files now use the `.eif` extension instead of `.bin`.
- Added Micro and Nano text editors to the Docker image to facilitate file editing directly from the shell.
- Moved the build script inside the EADKP library:
    - The build script is now integrated into the EADKP library, simplifying its use and integration into projects.
- Removed unused dependencies.
- [Critical] Modification of the build process to avoid issues when using eadkp as a dependency in other Rust projects:
    - The eadkp build script now only runs if the `EADKP_PRIMARY_BUILD` environment variable is set.
    - Moved the generation of the `icon.nwi` icon to the output folder specified by `OUT_DIR` to avoid conflicts when using eadkp as a dependency.
    - Declared `embedded-alloc` as a public dependency, allowing the `eadk_setup!` macro to use it without requiring a manual declaration in the user's `Cargo.toml`.
- Added the `.vscode/extensions.json` file to recommend useful VSCode extensions for eadkp development.
- Added the `push_image()` function in `display` to show an image from an `Image` object.
- The color of fully transparent pixels in included images is now white (`0xFFFF`) instead of black.
- Major issues identified:
    - Build failure of C/C++ files when the project uses eadkp as a dependency.
    - Deletion of the first character of saved files.
